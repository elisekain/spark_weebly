## Web Design: Things to Consider
- What is the purpose of this website?
- Who is our primary target audience? Do we have a secondary audience? Who else might visit our website?
- What is the most important information to share?
- What can we do to make our visitors come back and visit the page again?
- What devices/browsers will our visitors be using? Is our site responsive to different screen sizes?
- What can we do to convey a consistent "brand"?

## Web Design Quick Tips
- Create a visual hierarchy
  - Biggest text: most important information
  - Bolded text: this information is important too
  - Italic text: gives emphasis
- Start with only 1 or 2 fonts
  - Any text using a script font (looks like cursive) should be large and easily readable
  - Make sure there is high contrast between the background and the text
- Create a color palette using only a few colors (no more than 5) as a guideline.
- All of these rules are meant to be broken. Just make sure it's for a good reason!
